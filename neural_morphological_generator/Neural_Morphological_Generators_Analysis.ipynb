However, this list also includes reflexive versions of the verbs, see: \"veure\" (to see) and \"veure's\" (to see oneself). It might be interesting to check later in the evaluation step if the model has been able to infer correctly these specific formats of the verbs, since verb endings have, usually, information about what structure should we follow when deriving a verb."

        "* Data used can be downloaded here: https://github.com/unimorph/deu\n",
        "\n",
        "* This dataset contains 519,143 samples, formed by a total of 39,373 different stems.\n",
        "* In this case, we have verbs derived to different tenses but we also find adjectives and nouns.\n",
        "* It is worth mentioning that German uses declinations, meaning that words are identified given the particles that conform them and also can be derived to different cases. It is important to note that the morphology annotations here will be considerably different from Catalan.\n",
        "* German, unlike Catalan, does not change words depending on the gender of the subject, we could say it is gender-neutral (except for some specific words that have gender in the nature of the meaning itself). Also, the third person in singular has an additional case: whereas in Catalan there is only the equivalent to \"he\":\"er\", \"she\":\"sie\", German has the equivalent to \"it\":\"es\".\n",
        "* German is an agglutinative language, meaning that many words are formed by the combination and agglutination of other morphemes, making the grammar wide and sometimes complex. We can find very long words meaning a single thing."

        "* **Afix positioning**: we observe several underscores (_) which show the need of locating other words in between, as we have said German is an agglutinative language and structures can become complex very quickly.\n",
        "* **Letter swaps**: \"sichern\" has been derived as \"sichre\" when it should be \"sicher\". This phenomena is quite common when it comes to `-re` particles, but our model has not been able to infer this.\n",

This could be hinting the model what lemmas are nouns (starting in uppercase) and what are not (lowercase in all the word) but at the same time is making the model to interpret twice as much characters than if we only had lowercase.\n",
        "Basically, lowercasing is adding an unnecessary complexity to the model, given that the \"is a noun\"-information is already provided in the morphology tags (the information that appears after the # in `source_s`). One improvement to see if the model performs better (or not) is to train again replacing the uppercase letters with lowercase and see if \"the effort\" put into differentiating between upper and lowercase is canalized into learning to predict better."

However, as mentioned in the Catalan section, the `random` split results can be misleading, since we are training with information that appear later on the test set. This makes the model \"remember\" structures rather than infer them, thus the model is likely to not generalise well when facing an unseen sample.\n",

However, this would not imply a great improvement overall. This can be applied to any of the models (`random`, `no_overlap`, `fake_copy`).\n"
